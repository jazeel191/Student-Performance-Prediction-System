 Student Performance Prediction System

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts student marks based on study hours, sleep duration, and attendance percentage.  
Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.


# Project Overview
This project applies Linear Regression to explore how study habits and lifestyle factors influence academic performance.  
It demonstrates fundamental concepts of data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

# Workflow
1. Created a dataset of student performance metrics.  
2. Analyzed and visualized relationships between study habits and marks.  
3. Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.  
4. Evaluated model performance using MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.  
5. Predicted marks for new input data.
